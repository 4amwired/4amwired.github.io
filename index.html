<h1>I have a website!</h1>
<h2>Iam learning HTML </h2>
<h3>Now what happens if I write a third line with 3?</h3>
<h6>And how small is 6?</h6>
<h1>And back to 1 again, for the header?</h1>
<!-- <h2 style="color:crimson">And now to introduce color</h2> -->
<!-- Josh says that it's better to use RGB or hexadecimal stuff for color since each browser interprets color a different way. -->

<!-- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is better to use to add styles/properties to an individual element -->
<!-- <style>
  h2{color: blue;}
</style> -->
<h2>So now, because of my styling using CSS rather than inline style, this is blue. This replaces the previous styling I had for all h2.</h2>
<style>.blue-text {color: blue;} </style>
<!-- so now, I can just call this CSS class I just created for color like this: -->
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!-- CSS class selectors require a . at the beginning, but class declarations don't use a . -->
h1{font-size: 30px;} <!--this makes it so all h1 tags has that font. If I used a .h2font class (it's signified a class by the .), then I'd have to call it first). and a class is more specific than a tag and it trumps it. 
Eg: 
<style>  
  p {font-size: 16px;}
  .red-text {color: red;}  
</style> -->

h2{font-family: Sans-serf;} <!-- this does the font. You can also apply a Google font by making a call to Google (eg: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">) and putting that at the top of your code and then you can list the font just as you did before -->
<!-- if one font isn't available, you can have your browser "degrade" to another font by listing the fonts like this: font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif; -->
<!-- to add images, use the img element and point to a specific image's URL. All img elements MUST have an alt attribute, which is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image can't load: -->
<img class="larger-image" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tx5LG.jpg" alt="Electronic brain. ">
<!-- you can set the width (and border, etc.) of a picture too using a CSS property called width that controls an element's width. Just call the class before the src with a space in between.-->
<style>
  .larger-image {width: 500px;}
  .thin-blue-border {border-color: blue; border-width: 5px; border-style: solid;
</style>
