  <h2>August 4, 1912 - Unknown</h2>

<p>Raoul Wallenberg saved 100,000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi extermination, before being swallowed up into Stalin's Gulag, never to be heard from again. Below is a tribute, taken from <a href="http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/wallenberg/articles-47/wallenberg-effect/">www.raoulwallenberg.net</a>,  of this valiant man. </p>
<p>"...a volunteer was sought–someone who could go where Allied tanks and aircraft could not, and disrupt the insidious Nazi death machine.
No one could have been a less obvious choice for this mission than Raoul Wallenberg. Wallenberg was 32 years old in 1944, a wealthy upper-class Swede from a prominent, well-respected family. Sweden’s neutrality in the war was only one in a long series of ready-made excuses life had handed young Wallenberg, had he wanted to use them to refuse the rescue mission. He was not Jewish; he was rich; he was well-connected politically; he was in line to take the helm of the vast Wallenberg financial empire; he had everything to lose and nothing to gain by accepting this challenge...</p>
  <br>
  <p>Wallenberg and his aides would encounter a death march, and, while Raoul shouted orders for all those with Swedish protective passports to raise their hands, his assistants ran up and down the prisoners’ ranks, telling them to raise their hands whether or not they had a document. Wallenberg ”then claimed custody of all who had raised their hands and such was his bearing that none of the Hungarian guards opposed him. The extraordinary thing was the absolutely convincing power of his behavior,” according to Joni Moser...</p>
  <br>
<p>Virtually alone in the middle of enemy territory, outnumbered and outgunned beyond belief, Wallenberg worked miracles on a daily basis. His weapons were courage, self-confidence, ingenuity, understanding of his adversaries, and ability to inspire others to achieve the goals he set. His leadership was always in evidence. The Nazis and Arrow Cross did not know how to deal with such a man. Here was someone thickly cloaked in apparent authority, but utterly devoid of actual political or military power. Here was a man who was everything they wished they could be in terms of personal strength of character, but for the fact that he was their polar opposite in purpose.</p>
